Drivers installation method: https://youtu.be/xl7DQdApEW4

1  - Open Windows Device Manager
2  - Plug the adapter to a USB 3.0 port ( normally it has blue colour ) Doesn't have the adapter? Search for sony free PS4 camera adapter or buy one here https://ebay.to/35W8Qae
3  - Plug the camera to the adapter, you'll hear the device connection Windows sound.
4  - Look at the Device Manager for a new device under the "Other devices" called "USB BOOT". If not showing, check the connections, Sometimes, if you plug the camera with the adapter altogether, it will not be recognised. Also, make sure your pc has no USB power issues. If you run in USB power issues, please check this website for more info https://bit.ly/3mFmLYU or google for it.
5  - Download the windows driver here: https://bit.ly/35Of4st or here: http://bit.ly/31WKN9I Make sure you downloaded at least these 3 files: InstallDriver.exe, OrbisEyeCameraFirmwareLoader.exe, firmware.bin. I'm going to download the PS4-CAMERA-DRIVERS as ZIP to Desktop and extract all files to a folder called PS4-CAMERA-DRIVERS-master(you can rename it if you want).
6  - Navigate to the folder which you extracted the files and run InstallDriver.exe. Basically, you will need to click next and finish. Very easy installation.
7  - In the Device Manager, the "USB BOOT" will appear under the "Universal Serial Bus devices" We are almost there.
8  - Again in the same folder, run the OrbisEyeCameraFirmwareLoader.exe to upload the firmware to the camera. Don't worry, it will not be permanently saved in the camera.
9  - Now again in the Device Manager you should under the "Cameras" a device called "USB Camera-OV580". Done. 
10 - Now you can test it using the Windows camera app or your preferable camera software.
